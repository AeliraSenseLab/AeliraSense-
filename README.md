# 🌬️ AeliraSense: AI-Driven Blockchain Risk Detection

AeliraSense is an AI-powered tool for detecting token vulnerabilities, market shifts, and hidden threats in real time. Designed to help traders, analysts, and security researchers stay ahead of anomalies and protect their on-chain assets.

## 🌐 Overview

AeliraSense doesn’t just react — it *feels* the flow.  
Using advanced machine learning models, it scans live blockchain data to detect unusual patterns, alerting users before volatility turns dangerous.

Built for those who sense what others miss.

## 🔑 Key Features

**🧠 AnomalyVision**  
Flags subtle threats by analyzing outlier behavior in token price, volume, and liquidity — especially across small-cap assets.

**🌪 InstabilityAlert**  
Monitors unstable liquidity zones and predicts incoming turbulence using volatility clustering and depth fragmentation.

**⚠️ RiskPulse**  
Fuses real-time market sentiment with price action to signal areas of elevated risk before they manifest.

**🛡 SafeGuard**  
Performs dynamic stress tests on token contracts, revealing weak points in liquidity defense and transactional flow.

**🧬 CryptoGuard**  
Tracks slow-burn dangers — including dormant whale activity, stealth minting, and manipulative clustering patterns.

## 🧬 Open Source — AI Functions

Below are the core AI-powered functions used in AeliraSense to detect risks, predict market shifts, and protect user assets. Each function is designed to operate in real time within the browser extension and backend systems.

## 🧬 Aelira Intelligence Functions

### 1. 🧠 AnomalyVision — Detecting Hidden Crypto Risks

```javascript
function anomalyVision(transactionData) {
  const priceFluctuationRatio = Math.abs(transactionData.currentPrice - transactionData.previousPrice) / transactionData.previousPrice;
  const transactionWeight = transactionData.amount / transactionData.totalVolume;

  const anomalyScore = priceFluctuationRatio * transactionWeight;

  if (anomalyScore > 0.25) {
    return 'Alert: Hidden Risk Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Transaction Safe';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Assesses price fluctuation intensity relative to transaction size. Flags early-stage manipulations or insider movement when anomaly score exceeds 0.25.

### 2. 🌪 InstabilityAlert — Predicting Market Instability

```python
def instability_alert(market_data):
    volatility_score = market_data["price_change"] / market_data["previous_price"]
    liquidity_impact = market_data["total_volume"] / market_data["market_liquidity"]

    instability_risk = volatility_score * liquidity_impact

    if instability_risk > 0.6:
        return "Alert: Market Instability Predicted"
    else:
        return "Market Stable"
```
#### What it does: Evaluates volatility versus liquidity strength. Warns of unstable conditions before flash dumps or erratic price action.

### 3. ⚠️ RiskPulse — AI-Based Risk Forecasting

```python
def risk_pulse(asset_data):
    price_volatility = asset_data["price_change"] / asset_data["previous_price"]
    sentiment_score = asset_data["market_trend"]  # Range: 0 to 1

    risk_factor = price_volatility * sentiment_score

    if risk_factor > 0.75:
        return "Alert: High Risk Forecasted"
    else:
        return "Low Risk"
```
#### What it does: Combines volatility with off-chain sentiment signals to assess whether an asset is entering a high-risk phase.

### 4. 🛡 SafeGuard — Real-Time Asset Protection

```javascript
function safeGuard(assetData) {
  const protectionIndex = assetData.price * assetData.demandFactor;
  const riskFactor = assetData.volatility / assetData.marketLiquidity;

  const assetProtectionScore = protectionIndex / riskFactor;

  if (assetProtectionScore < 2) {
    return 'Alert: Asset Protection Needed';
  } else {
    return 'Asset Safe';
  }
}
```
#### What it does: Calculates how protected an asset is under market pressure. Warns when low demand and high volatility expose token fragility.

### 5. 🧬 CryptoGuard — Multi-Layer Risk Detection

```python
def crypto_guard(tx_data):
    complexity_score = (tx_data["amount"] * tx_data["token_age"]) / 1000
    market_risk = (tx_data["price_change"] * tx_data["market_depth"]) / tx_data["volume"]

    multi_layer_risk = complexity_score * market_risk

    if multi_layer_risk > 0.8:
        return "Alert: High Multi-Layer Risk Detected"
    else:
        return "Transaction Low Risk"
```
#### What it does: Analyzes temporal and market complexity — useful for identifying dormant whale activity, stealth accumulation, or orchestrated flows.
